# Korean Number Practice!

A React app for practicing reading Korean numbers quickly. Version 2 built with React and with better UI. 

Korean is a language with two number systems, one based on the native Korean language, and one based on borrowed number words from Chinese.  Both native and learning Korean speakers have to be familiar with both number systems, as they're both used in everyday life.

This app helps you practice reading in both number systems, by giving you simple addition problems using number words from either Native or Sino-Korean.  Input the correct answer and you'll automatically receive the next one.  You can also move up to a harder difficulty to practice adding 2-digit numbers together as well --- but that will test both your Korean ability and your mental math.  ;)

## packages:

npm and Yarn for package management, of course.

Webpack as our build system.

Babel for Javascript wrangling.

ESLint and Prettier for code formatting.

Mocha for unit tests.

React as framework.
